## üß™ How to Run Locally with XAMPP

1. **Extract `moodle.zip`**  
   Unzip it to get the `moodle/` folder and `rds_moodle_backup.sql`.

2. **Move `moodle/` into your XAMPP htdocs directory**

3. **Start XAMPP Control Panel**
- Start **Apache**
- Start **MySQL**

4. **Import the database**
- Go to: `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`
- Create a new database (e.g., `moodle-databse`)
- Click on the new DB ‚Üí Click **Import**
- Select `rds_moodle_backup.sql`
- Click **Go**

5. **Access Moodle via browser**
